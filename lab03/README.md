# Aspect oriented programming (AOP)
__Aspect-Oriented Programming__ entails breaking down program logic into distinct parts called so-called concerns. 
The functions that span multiple points of an application are called cross-cutting concerns and these cross-cutting concerns are conceptually separate from the application's business logic.

## AOP terms:

* Aspect
* Join point
* Advice
* Pointcut
* Introduction
* Target object
* Weaving
